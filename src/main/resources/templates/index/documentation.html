        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Temperature Log is a web application that allows its users to track temperature history in their
        neighborhood. It is intended to be mainly used automatically by ESP8266 microcontroller, however some
        features require manual user's interference. The purpose of the project is sheerly educational and
        recreative - by no means commercial.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="2">
        <h3>2. Data storage</h3>
        <p>Be aware that all information you share with Temperature Log will be publicly available. It is
        advisable to use special email account for registration. You have the right to delete your station
        at any time. Never reveal your accurate location (i.e. home address) on the website, use city
        name instead. Taking the purpose of the project, I cannot guarantee persistence and availability
        of the service.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="3">
        <h3>How to use Temperature Log?</h3>
        <div id="3a">
            <h4>3a. Registration</h4>
            <p>To register with Temperature Log use the form provided. You will be asked to provide your
            station's location (use city, country) and your email. I strongly advise against using your
            private email address, because it will be publicly visible on the website. After submitting
            a successful registration an email message will be sent to you. Keep it safe, as it contains
            your station ID and API key, which you will need to authenticate yourself in the service.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="3b">
            <h4>3b. Accessing station information</h4>
            <p>You can access information about the stations being currently registered. In order to view
            all stations make a HTTP GET request against "/api/stations/". To find a specified station
            use HTTP GET against "/api/stations/{stationId}", where {stationId} is a unique station
            number. All responses are provided in JSON format.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="3c">
            <h4>3c. Deleting your station</h4>
            <p>In order to delete your station you will have to provide your station ID and API key. Send
            a HTTP DELETE request against "/api/stations/{stationId}" with a header of pattern:
            key="api_key", value="yourapikey...". If station is successfully deleted response "Delete
            successful" is sent by the server.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="3d">
            <h4>3d. Accessing measurements</h4>
            <p>You can only view measurements from a specified station. To do so make a HTTP GET request
            against "/api/measurements/{stationId}". All responses are provided in JSON format.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="3e">
            <h4>3e. Uploading measurements</h4>
            <p>This functionality is intended to be used by ESP8266. A HTTP PUT request has to be sent
            against "/api/measurements". It must include a header of pattern: key="api_key",
            value="yourapikey..." and a JSON formatted request body with "stationId" and "temperature"
            parameters.</p>
