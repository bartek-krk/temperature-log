    <h1>Hi! It's Temperature Log!</h1>

    <p>Currently due to data storage limitations we cannot keep more than 750 readings form your station,
    which means you will no longer be able to submit a successful PUT request towards my API.</p>

    <p>I do acknowledge your contribution and looking forward to seeing you following my other projects!</p>

    Any enquiries: https://github.com/bartek-krk<br><br>

    Regards, Bartek - Temperature Log author<br><br>
